All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I thought the resize method where you just add the empty space before the first and last indexes was nicer. With my implementation, I had to worry about other special cases.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Every time I decremented the nextFirst or incremented the nextLast, I had the full code in every method. I should have just created a method to do that every time; it would have made my code more smooth.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I didn't just rush into it and planned my approach.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would start with the add methods, then work my way up slowly from there by testing every step of the way. I just brute forced my way through this and I ended up suffering for that.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Same as ArrayDeque, method for incrementing and decrementing nextFirst and nextLast.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Java Visualizer that was built into IntelliJ. Also the power of debugging and test methods.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would have worked my way up slowly with this (even more than ArrayDeque). I would have used the built in Java visualizer more often if I had been more familiar with it before starting.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Yeah I did like the idea of this, but I really wish it had been better enforced. Some people in lab showed up and left within 15 minutes.
